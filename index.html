        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education and Human Devlopment</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Yamileth Sanchez and I am a first year at the University of California Riverside. I am 18 years old and Mexican. I am the eldest in my family and I have two younger siblings in highschool. I love to dance, I like staying busy. In my free time I enjoy being outdoors and working out as well as spending time with family. My current interests are majoring in Education and Human Development with a concentration in learning and behavioural studies. I also plan to minor in Spanish. Ever since I was a little girl, I knew that I wanted to work with children, especially as a first generation. Some of the barriers I had to face with my parents was first the language barrier. My parents couldn't communicate their concerns with my educators because of the language barrier presented. They heavily relied on translators to assist their needs. Thus, one of my goals as a student is to obtain a Bachelor’s in Education and Human Development. I want to work with students who are double categorized low-income and first generation.<br><br>

        I want to work in dual immersion to be able to teach students in two languages. Establishing more dual immersion programs has always been something that has captivated my interest and I would like to improve in my community. The dual immersion program is a unique educational program designed to develop bilingualism and biliteracy in English and Spanish. This is a voluntary program. Instruction is provided by high trained and specialized teachers. Some benefits of the dual immersion program are new studies showing that a multilingual brain is nimbler, quicker, better able to deal with ambiguities, resolve conflicts, and even resist Alzeimher’s disease and other forms of dementia longer. My plans I have planned for my academic school year are to be involved in clubs, engage with my community, and research. In highschool, I danced ballet folklorico ( Mexican folk dance) . It's a way I like to relieve my stress but unfortunately with COVID-19 it's not possible to perform. However, when things begin to get better I want to be part of UCR’s Ballet Folklorico group. I also want to engage in research. I want to research how cultural pedagogy is being implemented in different levels of education. As well as finding other techniques that future educators and myself can engage and utilize in our classrooms. I also want to study abroad in the future in Spain to be able to take some Spanish courses when possible. 
<br><br>

        A little background about me is that I recently graduated from Rubidoux High School located in Jurupa Valley. I graduated with Highest Honors. Through highschool I was involved in various extracurricular activities. I was part of the girls varsity team and track and field. I was involved in student council and held a position as treasurer. I was treasurer and president for the National Honor Society. One of my peers and I helped form the MECHA club at my school to help give those students who felt marginalized a voice. This was after attending a MECHA conference hosted by UCR in this 3 day weekend conference we learned about the Chicao movement, what it means to identify as a Chicano etc. I was part of the Art and Culture club, this is the club where I performed at our rallies and typically performed for our community and parents like for Day of the Dead and Cinco de Mayo. Outside of school I was involved in the RCC Upward Bound Program which is a program designated for low-income. First generation students and help them pursue a college degree. In this program I benefited from tutoring, college visitations, assistance on scholarships etc. Currently, I am a team member at Chick fil- A I’m currently in the process of training some of the skills I have learned are how to multitask, manage money, talk with guests, and work as a team.
